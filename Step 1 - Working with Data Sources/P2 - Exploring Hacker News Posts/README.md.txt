In this project, we'll work with a data set of submissions to popular technology site Hacker News.

Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.

We will be performing an analysis of the Hacker News posts; Our initial goal is to anwser the following questions:
- Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?
- Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
