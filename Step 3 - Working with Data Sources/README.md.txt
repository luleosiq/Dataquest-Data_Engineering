n this guided project, we're going to practice using our SQL skills to answer business questions. In each step, we'll give you a task, and you'll need to:

    Write a SQL query to extract the relevant data
    Write a short paragraph, drawing conclusions and explaining the data and/or visualizations.

We'll continue to use the Chinook database that we've used in earlier missions of this course. The Chinook database is provided as a SQLite database file called chinook.db. A copy of the database schema is below - you'll need to come back to this step often to consult the schema as you write your queries.
